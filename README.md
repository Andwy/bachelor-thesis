# Analysis of the JaCaMo framework for programming multi-agent system through the simulation of a no-profit organisation
This is my thesis for the Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at University of Turin.
Language: Italian

##Abstract
Software had a turn toward concurrency, decentralization and distribution. In this context, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) received a strong attention in many fields. MAS are composed of a set of computational entities, the agents, capable of interacting with each other in a shared environment to solve a complex task. Modeling such a system means studying the interaction between each entity, the distribution of knowledge, resources or reasoning skills between them and the decentralization of the system. JaCaMo is a framework for developing a MAS: it tries to answer these questions, maintaining a strong orthogonality and synergy between the dimension of the agents, the dimension of the environment and the dimension of the organization.
This dissertation analyses the JaCaMo framework and its dimensions: 
i) the Agent-Oriented Programming (AOP), the BDI model and Jason, the platform for the development of the agents; 
ii) the Environment-Oriented Programming (EOP), the A&A model, the CArtAgO infrastructure for programming an environment based on artifacts;
iii) the Organisation-Oriented Programming (OOP), the organisational model of the MOISE and 
iv) the interactions between each dimension. 
Finally we discuss the study case developed during the stage: the simulation of a no-profit organisation in JaCaMo.
